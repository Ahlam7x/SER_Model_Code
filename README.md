# **Speech Emotion Recognition (SER) Model**

This repository implements a **Speech Emotion Recognition (SER) model** that integrates a **Co-Attention mechanism** to enhance feature fusion across multiple models. The architecture is inspired by the original [transformer-cnn-emotion-recognition](https://github.com/IliaZenkov/transformer-cnn-emotion-recognition) repository by Ilia Zenkov, with significant improvements and extensions.

## **üìå Overview**

This repository contains the implementation of a **Speech Emotion Recognition (SER) model** that utilizes advanced deep learning techniques for emotion classification in speech. The key features of this implementation are:

- **Co-Attention Mechanism:** A novel feature fusion technique that combines multiple model outputs for better performance.
- **Multi-Dataset Application:** The model is evaluated on three diverse datasets, namely **ASVP-ESD V1**, **ASVP-ESD V2**, and **ShEmo**.
- **Feature Extraction:** Combines **MFCC** and **Mel spectrograms** to improve emotion recognition accuracy.

üîç **Inspired by:** [transformer-cnn-emotion-recognition](https://github.com/IliaZenkov/transformer-cnn-emotion-recognition) by Ilia Zenkov.
